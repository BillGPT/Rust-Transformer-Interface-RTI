# Rust Transformer Interface (RTI)

## Introduction
The Rust Transformer Interface (RTI) is an open-source project aimed at providing a Rust-based interface to external language models such as those available through Hugging Face. This project is currently in the TODO phase, with the goal to replicate functionalities like generating embeddings and conversational AI capabilities natively in Rust.

## Current Features (Planned)
- **Interface to Hugging Face Models**: Call and interact with external models.
- **Generate Embeddings**: Convert input text into embeddings.
- **Conversational AI**: Implement dialogue systems using Rust.

## Getting Started (TODO)
Instructions for setting up the project locally will be provided as development progresses.

### Prerequisites (TODO)
- Rust latest stable version

### Installation (TODO)
Installation guidelines will be added once the package is ready for initial setup.

## Usage (TODO)
Example usage will be provided, detailing how to interface with Hugging Face models using Rust.
